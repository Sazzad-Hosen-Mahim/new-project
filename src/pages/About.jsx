          The effects of insomnia can impact nearly every aspect of a
          person&apos;s life and although there is effective medication
          available, it is often left untreated. This is why our team have come
          together to develop an online platform to address this need. With the
          internet and modern technology, our customers are now able to make use
          of e-commerce convenience and order their medication online.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-2xl">How our e-pharmacy can help</h1>
        <p className="my-2">
          Studies have shown that insomnia can negatively affect
          decision-making, reduce productivity and cause relationship
          difficulties. As many as 30 to 35 percent of adults suffer from this
          condition and most people with insomnia experience a worse overall
          quality of life. While some people have the occasional sleepless night
          which can be treated by simple changes to sleep hygiene, others
          experience trouble sleeping more frequently. Long-term insomnia can
          have devastating effects on a person&apos;s psychological and physical
          well-being. It can cause anxiety and depression and lead to health
          issues such as a weakened immune system and cardiovascular problems.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-2xl">Safe and effective treatment</h1>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Our website is a licensed online pharmacy that sells FDA-approved
          medications to relieve insomnia, anxiety and pain. Although insomnia
          can be a long-term condition that may seem difficult to treat,
          choosing a medication that works for you from our wide product range
          can provide an effective solution. The products we offer to treat
          insomnia include some of the most popular and frequently prescribed
          medications such as zolpidem and zopiclone.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Another common mental health condition is anxiety. One quarter of the
          adult population suffers from anxiety and only about 37% of people
          receive effective treatment. Having anxiety on occasion is considered
          normal but when it becomes continuous and has a negative impact on a
          person&apos;s quality of life, treatment is advisable. We provide
          medications that are commonly used to treat anxiety such as Xanax and
          Valium.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-2xl">Affordable medication</h1>
        <p className="mt-2">
          We also sell generic medications which are medically identical to
          their branded counterparts, so they offer the same effective results.
          The main difference is the price. Manufacturers of generics are able
          to produce and sell these medications at a much lower price because
          they did not incur the initial costs of launching a new medication to
          the market. Once the patent expires, they are permitted to produce
          generics. Competition in the market reduces the price even further.

          What happens if I change my mind about my order and want a refund?
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Normally, we only offer refunds under rare circumstances. If payment
          has been taken and goods have been dispatched, we are unlikely to
          offer a refund as medication cannot be restocked once it has left our
          storage facility. We do, however, consider each request according to
          the respective circumstances and so our refund policy will vary from
          case to case.

          I placed my order some time ago but haven&apos;t received it yet?
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Very occasionally, we come across customers who have not received
          their goods despite their goods being dispatched within 24 hours of us
          receiving the order. In almost every case, this is due to an incorrect
          address being provided by the customer for delivery. Our website
          cannot be held responsible for missing orders under these
          circumstances but we will do everything in our power to locate the
          missing goods and redeliver them. In the very rare event of orders
          being lost in the post (after investigation by our customer services
          department), we guarantee to resend the goods free of charge.

          How are you able to sell your products so cheap?
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3">
          We buy our supplies from main distributors in large volume and quite
          simply we are able to pass substantial savings on to the customer. We
          understand that if customers receive efficient, prompt service and are
          able to obtain the medications they need at budget prices, they are
          unlikely to shop elsewhere.

        <p className="mt-3">
          We dispatch all goods in plain padded envelopes that give no

          Is there an advantage to buying my medications from this website
          rather than my regular pharmacy?
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3">
          There are many advantages you can benefit from! Firstly, our online
          prices offer huge savings. We offer sleeping pills at what we believe
          to be the best prices on the internet. Secondly, you are able to
          personally decide which medications to buy that will best treat your
          medical condition. As some doctors do not seem keen to prescribe
          sleeping tablets and do not appreciate the disruptive influence
          insomnia can have on a person&apos;s life, they sometimes recommend an
          alternative treatment which is not as effective. Another great
          advantage to buying medications from our website is the level of
          privacy we offer. Your privacy is completely protected when buying
          from our website. We dispatch all goods in plain packages that provide
          no indication whatsoever of what is contained inside. The only person
          who will know what you have ordered from us is you.{" "}

          Is there a maximum number of pills I can buy in one order?

        <p className="mt-3">
          We never sell medications in larger amounts than advertised on our
          website under any circumstances. Our website is intended for use by
          ordinary individuals who suffer from insomnia related disorders and
          all medications sold are only to be used for personal use. The range
          of quantities we have for sale for each product reflects this policy.

          If you are suffering from Insomnia or anxiety then you know what type

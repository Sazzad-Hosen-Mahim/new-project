          What is Zopiclone?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
          Zopiclone tablets are often referred to as a z-medication and are the
          most popular medication used globally for the treatment of insomnia.
          While zopiclone is both the active ingredient and the name of the
          medication when sold in generic form, this medicine also goes under
          the trade names of Imovane, Zimovane and Datolan. Zopiclone is a very
          powerful sedative hypnotic medication that works by quickly promoting
          sleep in people who are struggling to sleep at night. This medication
          is usually used as a short-term treatment for insomnia and other
          disorders that affect sleep.

          How Zopiclone Tablets Work
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
          Zopiclone, although considered a non-benzodiazepine medication, has a
          very similar mechanism of action as that of benzodiazepines (which all
          work very similarly). To promote sleep, patients who buy zopiclone
          medication online should take it around 30 minutes before bedtime. The
          medication is than assimilated by the body and attaches itself to
          gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) neuro transmitters in the brain. The
          role of GABA is to regulate neural activity and ensure that the
          central nervous system remains in a state of relative harmony. This
          medication allows GABA to perform its function more swiftly to promote
          feelings of calmness and sedation in the brain in order to enable
          uninterrupted sleep for the duration of the night.

          When is it Right to use Zopiclone?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
          Before any type of sleeping medication is considered to treat
          insomnia, all natural means to treat sleeping problems should be
          attempted first. It is wise to avoid caffeine, alcohol and large meals
          close to bedtime as this often results in problems falling asleep or
          disrupted sleep during the night. Avoid sleeping during the day and
          try to go to sleep around the same time every night as this will help
          to establish a regular sleep routine.
          <span className="block mt-3">
            When all natural attempts fail to effectively treat sleeping
            problems, zopiclone tablets can be a fast, effective way to achieve
            a good night&apos;s sleep, however, they should only be used if you
            are 18 years or older and experience difficulty falling asleep at
            night or if your sleep is constantly disrupted throughout the night.

          Correct Dosage and Usage Instructions for Zopiclone 7.5 mg
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
          Zopiclone 7.5 mg is the most commonly used dosage, however, there is a
          3.75 mg option for those who require a lower dose. The lower dose is
          usually recommended for those over 65 years of age or those suffering
          from kidney and liver problems. Zopiclone should be ingested whole,
          and it can be taken with or without food but should not be crushed or
          chewed. The tablet must be taken around 30 to 60 minutes before
          bedtime, preferably at least 7 to 8 hours before you are expected to
          wake up. This is to avoid feeling drowsy, dizzy and tired when you
          wake up the following morning.
          <span className="block mt-3">
            If you forget to take the tablet, ensure that you do not take a
            double dose to make up for the missed tablet. Instead, take the next
            tablet as normal without trying to make up for the previously missed
            dosage. It is recommended that this medication is only used for a
            short period of time without a break - usually for between 2 to 4
            weeks. This is to prevent dependency and to avoid tolerance
            developing, where the medication becomes less effective for the
            patient.

          this medication if you have a history of substance abuse or have a

        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">What is Insomnia?</h1>
        <p className="text-justify mt-4">
          Insomnia can be defined as the inability to fall asleep at night. Most
          cases of insomnia can be transient and usually pass without the need
          for medical treatment but in some cases the problem can become
          chronic, which can cause a negative impact on life during waking
          hours. A person may be regarded as suffering from chronic insomnia if
          experiencing sleep problems 3 times per week or more and for 3 months
          or longer and to resolve this issue, many people rely on sleeping
          tablets to get to sleep at night.

        <h1 className="text-lg font-bold">Types of insomnia</h1>
        <p className="text-justify mt-4">
          There are a number of sleeping problems that may be defined as
          insomnia. These include problems falling asleep at night, waking up
          frequently throughout the night, or waking too early in the morning.
          These types of sleeping problems often leave sufferers feeling tired
          throughout the following day, resulting in under performance at work,
          lethargy and a general lack of drive and concentration.

        <h1 className="text-lg font-bold">Causes of Insomnia</h1>
        <p className="text-justify mt-4">
          There are a number of factors that may cause insomnia. Often, medical
          conditions can trigger periods of sleeplessness. These may include
          back pain, arthritis, gastrointestinal problems and sleep apnoea. Some
          medications are also known to cause sleep problems including medicines
          for the treatment of high blood pressure, asthma, nasal allergies and
          depression. Psychological factors can also be a major cause of
          sleeping disorders. Conditions such as anxiety, stress and depression
          often make it hard to fall asleep at night and many people resort to
          using sleeping tablets to get a good night&apos;s sleep. Sometimes, a
          recent traumatic experience or worrying about financial matters or
          relationship problems can make it difficult to fall asleep at night.
          In fact, around half of all cases of insomnia arise as a result of
          psychological stress.

          How to Deal with Insomnia without Sleeping Tablets
        </h1>
        <p className="text-justify mt-4">
          There are a number of ways to deal with insomnia problems without
          using sleeping tablets and some basic changes to routine and lifestyle
          habits can often enable a good night&apos;s sleep. There are also
          certain things that should be avoided before bedtime which are as
          follows:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
            <li>
              Large late evening meals. Heavy, fatty foods can cause
              indigestion, which will interfere with sleep if eaten too close to
              bedtime.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drinking large volumes of liquid. People tend to wake during the
              night to use the toilet if too much liquid is ingested too close
              to bedtime, so this should be avoided.
            </li>
            <li>
              Excessive caffeine intake, especially late in the day. Caffeine is
              a known stimulant which should be avoided during the evening to
              avoid problems falling asleep.
            </li>
            <li>
              Alcohol. Drinking alcohol often has a sedating effect but is known
              to cause frequent awakenings throughout the night.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <span className="block my-3">
            There are also some lifestyle habits that may need to be changed in
            order to have a beneficial effect on quality of sleep throughout the
            night. These include:
          </span>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 my-3">
            <li>
              Avoid naps throughout the day. Sleeping for short periods of time
              during the day normally has a detrimental effect on the ability to
              fall asleep easily at night
            </li>
            <li>
              The bedroom should only be used for sleep and sex. Taking part in
              other activities such as working, reading or watching television
              should be avoided. The aim is to make the mind associate the
              bedroom with sleep only and not activities that promote thought
              and emotion as this will only hinder attempts to fall asleep
              quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Relax when trying to fall asleep. Looking at the clock constantly
              or worrying about work or events taking place the following day
              will only increase anxiety levels. This will lead to increases in
              adrenalin levels, resulting in sleeplessness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Follow a regular routine when it comes to sleeping and waking
              times. The body is more easily able to fall asleep when a routine
              is followed - even at weekends if possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stop smoking. The body goes into nicotine withdrawal during the
              night if you smoke and this can lead to insomnia.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure you choose the right mattress. If you are sleeping on a
              mattress that is uncomfortable, it&apos;s going to adversely
              affect the quality of your sleep.

          Why and When Do You Need Sleeping Pills?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-justify mt-4">
          For people who suffer with severe or chronic insomnia, sometimes
          lifestyle changes alone will not be sufficient to provide a good
          night&apos;s sleep. In such situations, sleeping pills can be a fast,
          effective way to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep for the duration
          of the night. Although sleeping pills can provide fast results, they
          should not be regarded as a long term solution. In most cases, they
          are effective in breaking the cycle of chronic insomnia and their use
          can be gradually reduced over a number of weeks until they are no
          longer required.
          <span className="block mt-5">
            On a one-off basis, they can also be particularly useful when
            travelling on long haul flights when normal sleeping patterns are
            disturbed. To summarize, although highly effective, sleeping pills
            should be used for the short term treatment of insomnia when all
            other attempts to deal with sleeplessness issues have proved
            ineffective.

          Different Types of Strong Sleeping Pills Medication
        </h1>
        <p className="text-justify mt-4">
          There are a number of different medications which are known to quickly
          induce sleep when suffering from insomnia. The most commonly used
          sleeping tablets are zopiclone and zolpidem tartrate (Ambien),
          however, other effective medications for the treatment of sleeping
          problems include eszopiclone (Lunesta), temazepam (Restoril), diazepam
          (Valium) and nitrazepam (Mogadon). Most people find that a particular
          medication works best for them depending on the severity or type of
          insomnia being experienced.

          Can Sleeping Pills be Ordered Online to Treat Insomnia?

        <p className="text-justify mt-4">
          he answer to this question is yes, but some precautions are
          recommended before deciding to do so. All attempts to treat insomnia
          naturally with basic lifestyle changes should be exhausted first but
          if sleeping problems become chronic, using sleeping pills short-term
          can be an effective way to stop the cycle of sleeplessness. It should
          also be established that the website selling the sleeping tablets is a
          reputable one. All sleeping tablets available for sale should be
          licensed medications that have been deemed safe and effective for the
          treatment of insomnia problems.
